## Metabox CLI
Metabox is a Ruby based application which exposes a bunch of Rake tasks. That makes it possible to run metabox on windows, macbook and possible linux platforms without issues. We tested it well on windows 2008, windows 2016, windows 10 and MacOS.

In order to run metabox, several environment variables should be set first. Check "metabox documents environment variables" and minimal configurations.
